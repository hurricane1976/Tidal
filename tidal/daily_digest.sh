# Sends the digest once per day at 0800 Eastern, regardless of DST.
# Run hourly via cron; self-gates on local Eastern hour + a state file so
# it only actually sends once per calendar day even if cron fires more
# than once in the 8 o'clock hour.
#
# Josh asked (2026-08-25) to stop sending a digest every wake (was 15x/day)
# and instead send just one, in the morning, at 0800 EST. Implemented as
# an hourly local-time check against America/New_York rather than a fixed
# UTC cron time so it doesn't drift off 8am wall-clock time across the
# March/November DST changes.
